This section of the Technical Documentation provides several resources for developers designing, implementing and maintaining Translator software.  

- [[Quick Start]]
- **Graph Modeling Paradigms:**
    - [[Knowledge Graphs|Core knowledge graph principles]]
    - [Key Biolink Model components](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/guidelines/understanding-the-model.html)
    - [Getting started with Biolink](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/guidelines/using-the-modeling-language.html)
    - [Working with the model (tutorial)](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/guidelines/working-with-the-model.html)
- [[Developer Cookbook]]
- [[tutorials/index|Tutorials]]

- [[FAQ|Frequently Asked Questions]]

The actual deployment of the system is further documented in the [[../deployment-guide/index|Deployment Guide]].

An overview of the Translator Architecture is provided in the [[index|Architecture overview page]].  
Briefly, the system is composed of the following components:

1. [[Translator User Interface|User Interface (UI)]]
2. [[Autonomous Relay System|Autonomous Relay System (ARS)]]
3. [[Operations and Workflows|Workflow Runner]]
4. [[Translator Reasoner Application Programming Interface|Translator Reasoner Application Programming Interface (TRAPI)]]
5. [[The Translator SmartAPI Registry|Translator SmartAPI Registry]]
6. [[../architecture/ara/index|Autonomous Relay Agents (ARAs)]]
7. [[../architecture/kp/index|Knowledge Providers (KPs)]]

Tying together the above components are the activities, standards and service components of the Translator
[[../architecture/sri/index|Standards and Reference Implementation (SRI)]] project team.

Additional architecture details are stored in the
[Translator Architecture repository](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/TranslatorArchitecture).

## Joining the Translator Community as a Developer [draft]

* What are the mandatory technical requirements of having your stuff in Translator (Minimal standards; QA)
* How do keep quality assurance / gatekeeping in place; rubber-stamping; governance; vetting process for new internal KP's etc.  - Governance issues?
