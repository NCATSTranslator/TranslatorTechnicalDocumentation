# Welcome to the Biomedical Data Translator - Technical Documentation Site 
The vision of the Biomedical Data Translator ("Translator") program is to accelerate translational science "_through an informatics platform that 
enables interrogation of relationships across the full spectrum of data types_"
([Austin _et al._ 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12595), [BDTC 2019a](https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12591), [BDTC 2019b](https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12592), [Fecho _et al._ 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.13301), [[#references|other references]]). The goal is to build the infrastructure required to support and facilitate data-driven translational research on a large scale. The fundamental aim is to integrate as many datasets as possible, using a ‘knowledge graph’–based architecture, and allow them to be cross-queried and reasoned over by translational researchers. A fundamental tenet of the Translator program is open data, including open (de-identified) patient data, and open team science. _**[[About|Learn more...]]**_.

This site hosts the official technical documentation for Translator. Key sections of the documentation are:

- [[About|About the Biomedical Data Translator]]: general information about the Biomedical Data Translator ("Translator") project.
- [[Knowledge Graphs]]: Knowledge Graphs - the core scientific principle behind Translator.
- [[architecture/index|Translator Architecture]]: overview of the Translator knowledge integration platform.
- [[development-guide/index|Software Development Guide]]: guidelines for Translator software development, including tutorials.
- [[deployment-guide/index|System Deployment Guide]]: guidelines for Translator systems administration, including continuous integration testing, production deployment and monitoring.
- [[FAQ|Frequently Asked Questions]]

##  Licensing

Translator is intended to evolve into a global public good through open source and access licensing.
