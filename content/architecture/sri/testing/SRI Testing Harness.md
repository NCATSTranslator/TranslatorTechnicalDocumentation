The [SRI Testing Harness](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/SRI_testing) is a software testing system for the validation of TRAPI-wrapped Translator Knowledge Provider ("KP") and Autonomous Relay Agents ("ARA") components.

## Scope

The framework uses Biolink Model compliant sample 'edge' test data hosted online (see [[#specifying-the-tests|'Specifying the Tests']] below) as curated for each target KP, plus configuration information for associated Autonomous Relay Agents ("ARA") components, to formulate a [[https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/SRI_testing/blob/main/tests/onehop/README#how-the-testing-harness-works]] against these components, validating the request inputs and response outputs of the queries for compliance to specified releases of the TRAPI specification and the Biolink Model (both defaulting to '_latest_').

The current implementation focuses on [unit testing of so-called 'one hop' queries of knowledge graph resources](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/SRI_testing/blob/main/tests/onehop/README) using suitable permutations of the test data edge information into TRAPI **/query** endpoints of target components.  For each test edge (see below), the software also checks if inputs to the query are recovered in the output knowledge graph.

## Specifying the Tests

For KP components, [[https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/SRI_testing/blob/main/tests/onehop/README#kp-instructions]] are accessed as internet-visible resources, the URL for which is recoded in a special Translator SmartAPI Registry ("Registry") extension property called **info.x-trapi.test_data_location**.  For a KP, posting such a KP test edge data configuration file as a REST accessible JSON file, then registering a SmartAPI registry entry with the required **info.x-trapi.test_data_location** pointing to the JSON file URL, is all that needs to be done to have the component tested by the system.

For ARA's, these queries are derived from ARA-associated KPs listed in their [[https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/SRI_testing/blob/main/tests/onehop/README#ara-instructions]], also dereferenced via a Registry **info.x-trapi.test_data_location** specified URL. As for the KP, posting such an ARA configuration file and setting the required **info.x-trapi.test_data_location** property in the ARA Registry entry, is all that is required to have the SRI Testing harness conduct the test.

## Understanding SRI Test Results

Links to details concerning on the meaning of SRI Test results are available online on the general [[https://ncatstranslator.github.io/SRI_Testing/#user-documentation]].

## How it Works

The testing middleware leverages the [Pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/).  Essentially, the 'One Hops' PyTest script accesses Registry KP and ARA entries - which have their **info.x-trapi.test_data_location** properties set - to access the JSON test configuration data. Unit tests are then dynamically constructed as the cross-product of test edge data against semantic test types. These unit tests are then sequentially run then their output are captured as a hierarchical set of JSON documents which may be configured to be stored locally in the local filing system or within a Mongo database.

The back end validation of TRAPI message formats and Biolink Model compliance of message contents is mainly implemented in the complementary [Reasoner Validator](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/reasoner-validator) package (with user documentation [here](https://translator-reasoner-validator.readthedocs.io)), which itself leverages the [Biolink Model Toolkit](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model-toolkit) for Biolink Model validation.

A FastAPI web service API is coded which has endpoints to trigger a test run, monitor test run status and access the aforementioned hierarchical set of JSON [knowledge graph unit test](https://ncatstranslator.github.io/SRI_Testing/kg_unit_test_definitions.html) results which mainly consist of structured reports with [[https://translator-reasoner-validator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#validation_code_definitions]].

The web service application (with its default FastAPI OpenAPI.json file structured web page) may be directly invoked from the command line, or accessed from a running Docker container specified by the local docker-compose.yaml (and associated Dockerfile) specifications. Once again, test results are also saved as static JSON documents either in the filing system or a Mongo database (depending on mode of site configuration), and upon test run completion, may be directly viewed(*) outside of the running instances of the web service and test scripts.

(*) Note that the default for command line running is file storage if a Mongo database server is not already running; for Docker container runs, a MongoDb database is set running and is used. For the latter, the Mongo-Express application may be used to view the data (the Docker Compose **mongodb-compose.yaml** specification file is provided to facilitate this).

## Web Dashboard

A somewhat human user friendly web dashboard calls the various web service endpoints to create a series of structured views. The reference Translator deployment of the dashboard is deployed [here](https://sri-testing.apps.renci.org/). General user documentation for the dashboard is available on the [SRI Testing Git pages web site](https://ncatstranslator.github.io/SRI_Testing/web_dashboard_operations.html). The Javascript code is found in the ['dashboard' subfolder of the SRI Testing repository](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/SRI_testing/tree/main/dashboard).
