# About the Biomedical Data Translator

The [**Biomedical Data Translator**](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator)  program was launched by the
[["NCATS")](https://ncats.nih.gov|National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences ("NCATS")]] in Fall of 2016. ([Austin et al. 2019; BDTC 2919a/b;
Fecho _et al._ 2022; Unni _et al._  2022](index#references)). The **Biomedical Data Translator ("Translator") Consortium** 
is working collaboratively to realize the vision of the Translator program. 

The **Translator Consortium** is currently comprised of [[teams/index|~215 team members and 27 institutions]]. The program is [funded primarily through a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Other Transaction Awards (OTA) mechanism and an NIH contract awarded to support development of a Translator user interface (UI)](#consortium-funding).

An overview of the Translator timeline, in the context of key milestones and award funding from program inception through September 2022, is depicted below.

Translator is currently being used to promote serendipitous discovery and augment human reasoning in a variety of
disease spaces, including Fanconi anemia, systemic sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, Parkinsonâ€™s disease,
drug-induced liver injury, and many others.

## Key Programmatic Priorities

- **Quality Metrics/Benchmarking**: Identify quality metrics/benchmarking to evaluate query answers and verify that the system is robust and bug-free
- **Long-term Sustainability**: Develop and implement a long-term sustainability plan to allow for continued development and maintenance of Translator, should NCATS lose programmatic support
- **Solid User Base**: Engage both software developers and scientific end users from outside of the Translator Consortium
- **Documentation**: Develop easy-to-understand documentation and tutorials to more readily engage outside collaborators
- **User Interface**: Create a user interface to promote user engagement (initial release expected September 2022)

## Key Technical Achievements

- **Common Semantics**: the Consortium's inspired Biolink Model ([[index#references]]) has been adopted as a standard data model and upper-level ontology to support semantic harmonization across disparate ontologies and data/knowledge sources
- **Entity Resolution**: the Consortium's Standards & Reference Implementation ("SRI") team-implemented Name Resolution and Node Normalization services provide entity resolution to harmonize across disparate vocabularies and identifier systems
- **Common Queries**: the Consortium's OpenAPI-based Translator Reasoner Application Programming Interface ("TRAPI") has been adopted as an API standard to support query across Translator components
- **Discoverability**: the Consortium's support for the SmartAPI Registry provides a platform for discovering Translator tools and components, including metadata to explain what functionalities those components or services support
