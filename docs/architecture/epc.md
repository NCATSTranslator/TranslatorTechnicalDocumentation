# Evidence, Provenance and Confidence Metadata

The Evidence, Provenance and Confidence (EPC) team is working to model and standardize different subdomains of EPC metadata one at a time, based on priority of use cases and requirements. Standard Documentation and Implementation Guidance for each subdomain are provided as [Specification Documents](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI/tree/1.4/ImplementationGuidance/Specifications) in the TRAPI repository - as linked below.

1. **Supporting Publications:**  How to describe publications or other documents that support the knowledge expressed in an edge, by directly reporting the knowlege, or providing the evidence used to support it. See [Specification](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI/blob/1.4/ImplementationGuidance/Specifications/supporting_publications_specification.md)
2. **'At-a-Glance' Edge Provenance (knowledge level, agent type):** a small set of edge properties that provides a high-level EPC summary, allowing users to make a first-pass assessment of confidence and relevance for a given Edge. See [Specification](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI/blob/1.4/ImplementationGuidance/Specifications/knowledge_level_agent_type_specification.md).
3. **Retrieval Source Provenance:** How to report information resources from which the knowledge expressed in an edge was retrieved, whether directly or indirectly. See [Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/177sOmjTueIK4XKJ0GjxsARg909CaU71tReIehAp5DDo/edit#).
4. **Statement Provenance:** How to describe the provenance of the knowledge as expressed in an edge, including who authored the statement, when they did so, and what reasoning methods/guidelines they used in doing so. Specification in progress.
5. **Evidence and Supporting Data:** How to report information interpreted as evidence in generating the knowledge expressed in an edge, and describe its provenance, e.g., details of experimental design or analyses performed to generate the evidence. Specification in progress.
6. **Statement Confidence:** How to report on the level of confidence an agent has in the truth of the knowledge expressed in an edge.  Specification in progress.
