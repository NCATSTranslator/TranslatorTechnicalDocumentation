# Evidence, Provenance and Confidence Metadata

The EPC Modeling team is working to standardize different subdomains of EPC metadata one at a time, based on priority of use cases and requirements.

1. **Retrieval Source Provenance:** How to report information resources from which the knowledge expressed in an Edge was retrieved, directly or indirectly. See [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/177sOmjTueIK4XKJ0GjxsARg909CaU71tReIehAp5DDo/edit#).
2. **Supporting Publications/Documents:**  How to describe publications or other documents that support the knowledge expressed in an edge (by directly reporting this knowlege, or providing evidence used to support it)
3. **'At-a-Glance' Knowledge Provenance:** a small set of edge properties that provide a high-level EPC summary, allowing users to make a first pass assessment of confidence and relevance for a given Edge.
4. **Statement Provenance:** How to describe the provenance of the knowledge as expressed in an Edge - including who authored the statement, when they did so, and what reasoning methods/guidelines they used in doing so. 
5. **Evidence and Supporting Data:** How to repor information interpreted as evidence in generating the knowledge expressed in an Edge, and describe its provenance (e.g. detials of experiments or analyses performed to generate the evidence).
6. **Statement Confidence:** how to report on the level of confidence an agent has in the truth of the knowledge expressedin an Edge. 

Model Documentation and Implementation Guidance for each subdomain are provided for now as links to external resources, which will be unified/centralized here in future efforts. To date, only the first subdomain has been fully standardized, as described in documents linked above.
