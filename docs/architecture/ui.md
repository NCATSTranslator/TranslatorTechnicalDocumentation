# Translator User Interface

The primary Translator User Interface (UI) is under development as a [web portal](https://ui.transltr.io/) to the Translator system that receives scored results and evidence, confidence, and provenance from the ARS and exposes results to users. This section doesn't cover the use of the UI, but rather, technical details facilitating its further development and maintenance.
