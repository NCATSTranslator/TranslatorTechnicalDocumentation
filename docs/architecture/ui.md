# Translator User Interface

The [Translator User Interface (UI)](https://ui.transltr.io/) is under development as the primary access point to the Translator system. The UI receives scored results and evidence, confidence, and provenance from the ARS and exposes results to users. This section isn't intended to cover the use of the UI, but rather, technical details facilitating its further development and maintenance.
