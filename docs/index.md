# Welcome to Developer Documentation for the Biomedical Data Translator

The [**Biomedical Data Translator** ('Translator')](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator)  program was launched by the
[National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences ("NCATS")](https://ncats.nih.gov) in Fall of 2016. 

The vision of the Translator program is to accelerate translational science “through an informatics platform that 
enables interrogation of relationships across the full spectrum of data types” ([Austin et al. 2019; BDTC 2919a/b;
Fecho _et al._ 2022](about/index.md#references)). The goal is to build the infrastructure required to support and 
facilitate data-driven translational research on a large scale. The fundamental aim is to integrate as many datasets
as possible, using a ‘knowledge graph’–based architecture, and allow them to be cross-queried and reasoned over by
translational researchers. A fundamental tenet of the Translator program is open data, including open (de-identified) 
patient data, and open team science. [_**Learn more...**_](about/index.md).
