# Welcome to Developer Documentation for the Biomedical Data Translator

The [**Biomedical Data Translator** ("Translator")](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator)  program was launched by the
[National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences ("NCATS")](https://ncats.nih.gov) in Fall of 2016. 

The vision of the Translator program is to accelerate translational science "through an informatics platform that 
enables interrogation of relationships across the full spectrum of data types"
([Austin _et al._ 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12595), [BDTC 2019a](https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12591),
[BDTC 2019b](https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12592), [Fecho _et al._ 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.13301),
[other references](about/index.md#references)). The goal is to build the infrastructure required to support and 
facilitate data-driven translational research on a large scale. The fundamental aim is to integrate as many datasets
as possible, using a ‘knowledge graph’–based architecture, and allow them to be cross-queried and reasoned over by
translational researchers. A fundamental tenet of the Translator program is open data, including open (de-identified) 
patient data, and open team science. [_**Learn more...**_](about/index.md).
