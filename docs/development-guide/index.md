# Guide for Developers

This section of the Technical Documentation provides several resources for developers designing, implementing, testing and maintaining Translator software.  

## Overview of Primary Translator standards
- [Introduction to Knowledge Graphs and the Biolink Model](../architecture/biolink/knowledge_graphs.md)
- [Translator networking protocol: the Translator Reasoner Application Programming Interface (TRAPI)](../architecture/sri/trapi.md)
- [Workflows](../architecture/workflows.md)

## Coding against Translator
- [“Hello Translator” Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/TranslatorTechnicalDocumentation/blob/master/docs/development-guide/HelloTranslator.ipynb) providing a quick (Python) programmatic introduction to Translator interfaces and knowledge graph data.
- [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)
- [Guidance for Testing](../architecture/sri/testing/index.md)

An overview of the Translator platform is provided in the [Architecture overview page](../architecture/index.md).  Briefly, the system is composed of the following components:

1. [User Interface (UI)](../architecture/ui.md)
2. [Autonomous Relay System (ARS)](../architecture/ars_usage.md)
3. [Autonomous Relay Agents (ARAs)](../architecture/ara/index.md)
4. [Knowledge Providers (KPs)](../architecture/kp/index.md)
5. [Workflow Runner](../architecture/workflows.md)
6. [Translator SmartAPI Registry](../architecture/registry.md)

Tying together the above components are the activities, aforementioed primary standards and service components of the Translator
[Standards and Reference Implementation ("SRI")](../architecture/sri/index.md) project team.

Additional architecture details are stored in the
[Translator Architecture repository](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/TranslatorArchitecture).
